# Upsurge
A (parkour) server plugin for Classicube MCGalaxy servers.

## How to Install
- Add `sqlite3_x32.dll` and/or `sqlite3_x64.dll` to the folder containing `MCGalaxy.exe`. This is for compatibility with a number of SQL queries.
- Add `.../Debug/net4.0/parkour.dll` into the plugins folder.
- Use `/pload parkour` in the MCGalaxy command line interface to load the plugin.
